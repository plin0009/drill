# drill

## Inspiration

I'm a high-school student. It's the time of the year where we're all reminded how plain boring school is. Often, we are confined to textbook readings and brute-force memorization.

Education is an often underestimated area of concern, especially when it's where change starts. I wanted to make something that allows the ones other than textbook learners to succeed in our school system.

## What it does

The goal of Drill is to make interactive learning solutions accessible, efficient, and accurate. Take a textbook or a Wikipedia page, feed it into the page, and a Drill will be ready to run in the blink of an eye! Sending the link to fellow learners allows for multiple parties to join one learning environment.

## How I built it

I built the front-end using the React framework styled with the Bulma CSS library. I used Illustrator to create the logo. I used Parcel to build everything into a static assets folder. I used Firebase Hosting to hook up my pages to my domain from Domain.com.

I also took advantage of Firebase Functions and Google's Natural Language API's entity and syntax analysis to break sentences down so I could turn them into questions with a single API endpoint. Firebase Realtime Database allowed me to create, store, and run Drills.

## Challenges I ran into

Working alone can be draining, and it comes with a lot of time pressure. It's impossible for 30-something hours to illustrate my vision for this project. The essence of the idea itself was already hard to implement in the time constraints. I had to come to peace with this and produce what I can with the time given.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

* Came up with the idea in advance!
* Took advantage of Firebase Database, Storage, and Functions tools
* Didn't give up on the idea despite difficulties
* Did it by myself!

## What I learned

* I learned what Natural Language Processing is and how it's useful
* I learned how Firebase works behind the scenes (and the capability of the Realtime Database)
* I learned that food and breaks are necessary

## What's next for Drill

* Authentication and user system for easy storing/running of Drills
* Improved algorithms (speed and accuracy) for the generation of questions
* Visual and speech recognition as input
* Uploading files as input
* Improved UX/UI
* Much more (open to feedback!)
